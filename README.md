# FIGARO Interpretability study

You can use the `FIGARO_interpretability.ipynb` file to run all of the experiments.

This code is built on top of the original FIGARO repository. The main code additions are in the Jupyter notebook, and the following files:
- `models/probe.py`
- `models/seq2seq.py`
- `train_probe.py`
